# Project Name: 
Pat's Salmon Cookies
**Author**: Brandon Fenty
**Version**: 1.0.0 
​
## Overview

This application is designed to track the amount of customers and the average number of cookies they buy both inside individual stores as well as all 5 stores as a whole. This data will be translated into a sales page for Pat, the owner, so she can see how many cookies were sold during each hour of the day at each different location. Since it will also be tracking the number of customers in the store each hour (in a similar fashion as the number of cookies sold), an average number of cookies sold per customer will also be provided. Finally, as a seperate page to the sales information application, a store front will be created so that potential customers can access information about the stores and see what the business has to offer, where they are located, images of the products, and how to contact.
